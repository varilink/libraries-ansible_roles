# The default "stride" in minutes for executing the dynamic DNS update script.
# This default value of 15 results in the script being run at 0, 15, 30 and 45
# minutes past the hour. If the value was say 20, that would result in the
# script being run at 0, 24 and 40 minutes past the hour. If you override the
# value then it must be set to a positive integer that is a divisor of 60.

# Directory that will hold the per record, dynamic DNS configuration files. Each
# file specifies an A record to be kept in step with our ISP provided IP
# address by providing the relevant Linode DNS Ids for both the domain and the
# record.

# Normally the dynamic-dns.pl script uses Linode's [remote_addr] placeholder for
# the current, dynamically assigned IP address. However, there's been at least
# one instance when this wasn't working due to a bug. So, this parameter can be
# overridden to use the ipify API to get our IP address instead.
