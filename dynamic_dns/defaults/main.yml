# The default "stride" in minutes for executing the dynamic DNS update script.
# This default value of 15 results in the script being run at 0, 15, 30 and 45
# minutes past the hour. If the value was say 20, that would result in the
# script being run at 0, 24 and 40 minutes past the hour. If you override the
# value then it must be set to a positive integer that is a divisor of 60.
