    # Setup to obtain Let's Encrypt certificates if SSL if required on this
    # host. We use SSL on any host that will provide externally facing websites,
    # but we might not do so on a server that hosts internally facing websites,
    # for development only for example.

    # NOTE: certbot renewals
    # If systemd is available, installing the certbot apt package creates and
    # activates a systemd timer unit called certbot.timer to "Run cerbot twice
    # daily". The associated systemd service unit (certbot.service), executes
    # certbot's renew subcommand. The equivalent CRON setup is then disabled
    # since the CRON job executes certbot's renew subcommand only if it does NOT
    # find /run/systemd/system to be present.
