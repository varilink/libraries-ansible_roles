# Installs the APT packages required by the backup_client role. Across our
# various environments we have backup clients on stretch, buster and bullseye.
# We also have backup directors and backup storage daemons on buster and
# bullseye.

# If the backup director or backup storage daemon is installed on buster, then
# we use buster-backports for compatibility with backup clients installed on
# bullseye. The host of the backup director and/or backup storage daemon is also
# a backup client and if that host uses buster then the backup client can not be
# installed unless it uses buster-backports too. The easiest way to address this
# is to use buster-backports whenever a backup client is installed on buster.
