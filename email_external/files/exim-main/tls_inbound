# Enforce TLS on connect for connections to us on port 465
# Note that this macro only takes effect because of the edit we make to

# TLS_ON_CONNECT_PORTS section to Exim's main config tlsoptions"
TLS_ON_CONNECT_PORTS = 465

# If tls_sni is defined then use it to define the MAIN_TLS_CERTIFICATE and
# MAIN_TLS_PRIVATEKEY macros to return a domain specific certificate and private
# key. First look for a Let's Encrypt certificate and private key for the SNI
# domain and if they are found then use them. Failing that look for a self-
# signed certificate and private key for the SNI domain and again if they are
# found then use them.
#
# If either tls_sni isn't defined or no certificate and private key are found
# for the SNI domain then these macros will be undefined. In the case, the logic
# in 03_exim4-config_tlsoptions will use the certificate and private key at
# CONFDIR/exim.crt and CONFDIR/exim.key respectively.
#
# NOTE: The logic below extracts the domain from tls_sni values by using the
# substr function with an offset of 5. That's because our host naming convention
# is smtp; for example smtp.varilink.co.uk for the domain varilink.co.uk. If we
# start to allow different host naming conventions then a more flexible way of
# doing this will have to be found.
