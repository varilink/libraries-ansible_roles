# This is a custom router, i.e. not one that comes with the exim4 package in
# Debian. This host's Exim configuration type is smarthost. If the message being
# processed is for a non-local domain then it would be processed by the
# smarthost router in 200_exim4-config_primary.
#
# This custom router is placed so as to intercept the routing for some messages
# before they are tested against that smarthost router so that they get routed
# by this smarthost_for_sender_domain router instead. Relative to the smarthost
# router there are two changes here:
# 1. The debug_print message includes the sender address domain
# 2. The transport is remote_smtp_smarthost_for_sender_domain rather than
#    remote_smtp_smarthost
