#################################

# This router delivers mail to any dovecot "virtual" user who has a directory
# under /home/vmail/. A virtual user corresponds to an email address within a
# customer domain that we provide the mail service for. The users are virtual
# in that they do not correspond to operating system users, which correspond to
# home (or "real" as opposed to "virtual") domain. This router is placed after
# the real_local router and before the system_aliases router.
