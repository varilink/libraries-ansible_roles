{#
According to the resolv.conf man page, "The domain directive is an obsolete name
for the search directive that handles one search list entry only." However, It
is often included in automatically generated resolv.conf files; for example,
when a Linode VM is created. So, I include it here regardless of the fact that
the resolv.conf man page says that it is obsolete.

Note that we cannot apply any changes to the /etc/resolv.conf file on our Linode
VMs as the Linode hosting service will overwrite them with its own
/etc/resolv.conf file. For this reason it's pointless to deploy this dns_client
role to those hosts.
