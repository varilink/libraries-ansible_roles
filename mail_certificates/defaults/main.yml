# Mail uses Certification Authority (CA). By default use self-signed
# certificates for domains configured on the mail service. If this is set to
# yes then we use Let's Encrypt as a certification authority instead. This
# requires integration with the Linode domain zone management system so that
# Let's Encrypt can validate certificate requests.
